## Decisions

### Why FastAPI?

Reason:
- Lightweight
- Excellent documentation
- Strong type support
- Lets us focus on DevOps instead of framework complexity

Status:
Accepted

---

### Git Workflow

- Small logical commits
- Conventional Commits
- Push after every milestone

Status:
Accepted

---

### Database

Decision:
Use PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM and Alembic.

Status:
Accepted

---

### API Design

- REST API
- JSON responses
- Pydantic request/response models

Status:
Accepted

---

### Authentication

Decision:
Use Argon2 (`pwdlib`) for password hashing and JWT access tokens for stateless authentication.
Store only hashed passwords in the database and include only the authenticated user's ID (`sub`) in the JWT payload.

Status:
Accepted

## Next Session

Implement route authentication and task ownership.

Topics:

- Authentication dependency (`get_current_user`)
- JWT validation
- Protected routes
- Associating tasks with authenticated users
- Restricting users to their own tasks
